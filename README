I have included a video titled "demov_ideo.mp4", it is on the root folder. This video is just to prove that no cheating were done, and the output videos are solely from the execution of my RAG implementation. 

You can refer to the notebook, there is a details description of every milestone and the code.

The vidoes that answers the 3 questions are under the folder "output_videos". The videos name matches the questions it is answering. And RAG implementation is inside "project.ipynb"
